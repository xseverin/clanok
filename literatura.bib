abstract = {In this paper, we discuss how Go, a strategy game widely played in Asia and other parts of the world, provides a rich, challenging environment for capstone and undergraduate research projects. We first describe the game itself and the characteristics that make it appropriate for more advanced undergraduate projects. We then discuss several projects that our students have pursued over the last three years, and we share observations that may be helpful to other computer science educators.},
